🧩 Advanced Scrapyard – The Ultimate Vehicle Recycling System for FiveM
🔧 About This Script

Players can bring stolen, abandoned, or damaged vehicles to designated scrapyards and earn money or materials based on the car type, condition, and configurable randomness.

💡 How It Works

A player drives a vehicle to your scrapyard location.

The script checks if it’s a valid vehicle (based on your config).

A scrapping animation starts, with sounds, effects, and a progress bar.

Once complete, the player receives a reward (money or items).

The vehicle is deleted from the world — clean, simple, and immersive.

🎨 Customization

Change all blips, notifications, and text to match your server’s theme.

Configure every setting easily inside config.lua — no need to touch main files.

Add multiple scrapyards, special rewards, or even job-based restrictions.

Perfect for economy balancing or creating a fun side job for players.
